# learn-hackathons
Use of Deep Learning Algorithms to solve hackthons and learn new ways of solution development along the way.

Due to the time bound nature of these problems, the focus is on trying multiple ways to solve the problem than focussing on code structure for now

Happy Learning & Coding !!
