Overall Solution Process:

Basically used Deep Learning Fast AI module with different transfer learning modules. The main challenge was to gather multiple images for training by using different websites and futher cleaning the data.

Also tried a Keras based modules in order to try the Inception archtiecture but did not get a very good accuracy with the same
