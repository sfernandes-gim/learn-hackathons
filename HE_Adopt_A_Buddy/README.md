This solution was for a Hackathon for identification of the Breed Category and Pet Category from the given attributes. The main challenge included missing data and Imbalanced data set 

Was able to reach top 4% within the leader board

Accuracy: 89.86% (Top 3 %)

Problem_Statement: https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/pet-adoption-9-5838c75b/

Overall Solution process:

Stage 1:

Used Random Oversampler to Balance the Data Set and use of Random FOrest to predict the missing value of Condition Column. Can look at SMOTE etc.

Stage 2: Use of Fast AI tablular learner to develop the predictions in a sequenitial manner
Further improvments could be an ensemble with RF and Hyper Parameter Tuning
